Seed photo folders for products.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Put 3â€“5 JPG files in each product folder, named consecutively:

   1.jpg   (primary image shown in cards)
   2.jpg
   3.jpg
   4.jpg   (optional)
   5.jpg   (optional)

You can place PNGs first; the app expects JPGs, so keep to .jpg if possible.
If you only have PNGs, just rename after converting. The backend will
ingest and store them by upload.
